Our weekly BA Dinners are an excellent way to relax after a long week in the lab or library, with some good food and good company.
We will be serving pre-drinks from 7:15 p.m., with dinner starting at 8 p.m. except the BA Feast, for which pre-drinks will be at 7 p.m. and dinner at 7:30 p.m..
The location of pre-drinks will usually be the OCR (Old Combination Room) and the Bar unless otherwise announced.

## Seating System
We are currently testing a system where seats can be reserved for groups of six or more people through [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeiMcROnSBz43v4OfU2zqv_4QHj0lvAyJARPNu_lDq_hBzFqg/viewform).
Reservations should be submitted by 11:59 p.m. on the day preceding the formal.
Reservations for more than 10 people require permission from the Dean according to the White Book, therefore these will only be considered if we receive a copy of this permission before the deadline.
Requests are granted on a first come, first served basis.

The total number of seats that can be reserved is ~100 (50% of all seats). If you have seats reserved, please take the seats labelled with your group's name. If you do not have seats reserved, please choose from the seats that are not reserved for any of the groups.

## Guests
We are very happy with you bringing guests to formal.
However, keep in mind that as the host, you are responsible for your guests and their behaviour.
It is also your responsibility to make sure that, if they are under 18, they do not drink alcohol.
Please note that children younger than 8 years may not attend formal dinners according to College regulations.
