The BA Rooms may be booked using the form below under the following rules:

* There can only be 6 people or two households in the main room, and 3 people or one household in the TV room.
* Only one room can be booked at a time (i.e. there cannot be one group in the TV room and one group in the main room).
* You must wipe down surfaces before and after use.
* You must have a window open.
* There must be a 30 minute gap between bookings to prevent mixing of groups.
* There is a 3 hour maximum for bookings but you can book 1, 2 or 3 hour slots.
* The full names, CRSids, phone numbers and addresses of all people that will be in the room are required for the booking (phone numbers are for test & trace, addresses are for porters to check to make sure it's just two households).
* Porters will have access to the booking calendar and do spot checks on their rounds.
* Only Trinity students are allowed (until the guest policy changes).
* Masks must be worn unless eating/drinking.
* No shouting, singing or exercise is to take place.
