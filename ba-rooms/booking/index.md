The College Council has agreed to allow a trial of indoor mixing between households in the BA Rooms to see what impact it has on the COVID rates in College. This means you can now have dinner parties, movie nights and anything else you can think of indoors with other Trinity College members from different households. You'll have exclusive use of both the kitchen/lounge area and the TV room upstairs for the duration of your booking.

There are rules that need to be followed so that we can keep access to the BA Rooms and if you choose not to follow them your access to the rooms can be revoked at the request of the Dean, Porters or the BA Committee. The Porters will have access to all the booking information and will do spot checks to make sure the rules are being followed.

In order to book the room for 1-3 hours you'll need to have everyone's name, CRSid, phone number and address (you can book the room and add this info later but if it's not entered 24 hours before the booking it will be cancelled). The person who books the room will also have to give their email address through which all correspondence will happen (plus you will get sent a link for you to make changes to your booking).

- Only 6 people or two households to be in the main lounge/kitchen room
- Only 3 people or one household to be in the TV room
- Wipes are provided and must be used on all surfaces before you use the room and when you leave
- Hand sanitiser to be used when entering the room
- Masks to be worn unless eating/drinking or if you are only in the room with your own household
- At least one window needs to be open fully or at least two windows open on different walls if only opened a small amount
- Only Trinity members are allowed in the BA Rooms until the guest policy changes
- Only people listed on the booking form are allowed into the room - changes can be made to your booking right up until the time of the booking so you can swap people and add others
- No shouting, singing or exercise is to take place
- You cannot move the furniture
- All dishes are to be washed and appliances wiped down
