**Television room bookings are currently suspended due to refurbishment.**

The BA Rooms are situated on the first floor of I Staircase, Great Court. The Junior Common Room, which graduates are also entitled to use, is just next door. You will need your University card to access both rooms.

The BA Rooms are split over two levels. On the lower level is a common room and a recently refurbished kitchen. The kitchen contains a conventional oven, microwave, kettle, and coffee machine. Tea and coffee are available in the cupboard above the stove. Please do not remove anything from the kitchen, and do wash up, wipe down tables and surfaces, and generally clean up after use. Make sure the kitchen is left in a better state than you found it.
Upstairs from the common room is a television room, which is currently being refurbished.

## Booking

### Booking the BA Kitchen
It is possible to book the kitchen for periods of no longer than 4 hours if you'd like to hold dinner parties. This reservation is just for the kitchen, and not the entire common space; there is a pull-out screen to separate the two spaces which you should feel free to use. Please be courteous with your reservations and recognize that the BA Kitchen is a common resource for all Trinity graduates. Kitchen availabilities can be viewed [here](http://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=ba.kitchen%40googlemail.com&ctz=Europe/London).

Click "Create Event" and make sure to add your name and contact details along with the date and time you wish to use the kitchen. Have fun, and make sure to clean up! If you find that you will not need the kitchen, please remove your booking as soon as possible so others know that the space is available.
