## Equipment & Court Bookings

The BA Society owns a selection of sports equipment, which is stored in the Burrell's Field Porters Lodge. There are:

* Badminton rackets and shuttlecocks
* Squash rackets and balls
* Tennis rackets and balls and
* Table tennis paddles, a net and balls
* Cricket balls
* Croquet set (Main Site Porters Lodge)

These can be borrowed by any Trinity BA and their guests. Badminton and squash courts are booked online. If your Raven account is associated with your department rather than Trinity, you may need to contact the TC Badminton Club secretary or myself to arrange addition to the approved student list. The BA Croquet set (quite heavy) is stored at the Main Site Porters Lodge (Great Gate), and you will need to sign for it and return it after use.

If there is any problem with this equipment, rackets need restringing, etc, [email the BA Sports Rep](mailto:ba.sports@trin.cam.ac.uk). Also, suggestions of new equipment the Society could buy are very welcome!
