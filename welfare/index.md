Graduate life can be stressful and occasionally problems may arise for which you want the help of others. There are several people and resources you can turn to for help and direction.

A good first port-of-call in difficulty is your tutor, who is responsible for your welfare in College. They all have a tutor's secretary, and will happily arrange an appointment. Tutors usually end up dealing with any matters relating to your academic studies, but can also advise you on your options in other matters too.

The College Nurse is available for help with any medical problems and  can be found at the Health Centre in B Nevile's Court from 8:30-11 a.m. and from 12-2 p.m. on Monday to Friday during Full Term (during Term, the hours end at 1 p.m. instead of 2 p.m.). The nurse can also be contacted by phone at (3)38471 and [by email at surgery@trin.cam.ac.uk](mailto:surgery@trin.cam.ac.uk).

The College also has a dedicated College Counsellor who is available to talk about personal or work-related problems. ([book appointments at counsellor@trin.cam.ac.uk](mailto:counsellor@trin.cam.ac.uk)). There is also a Mental Health Advisor who takes self-referrals ([book appointments at jb732@cam.ac.uk](mailto:jb732@cam.ac.uk)). And, the [College Chaplains](http://trinitycollegechapel.com/whos-who/) are always there too for confidential chats and support.

If you would prefer to talk to another student, [Annalise Higgins](mailto:ba.liaison@trin.cam.ac.uk) is the Welfare Officer on the BA Society Committee, and she will do her best to make sure you get the help you want or need. If you rather, you may also contact the Women's Officer, [Natalie Jones](mailto:ba.women@trin.cam.ac.uk). Any discussion you have with the Welfare Officers is completely confidential, unless you wish otherwise.

The [University Counselling Service](http://www.counselling.cam.ac.uk/) is another source of support. They offer individual or group counselling and hold a number of workshops that are run throughout the year, however they only operate during term.

The [GU](http://www.gradunion.cam.ac.uk/facilities/support/#studentsupport) and [CUSU](http://www.cusu.cam.ac.uk/welfare/) both have excellent welfare information on their websites and together they run the [Student Advice Service](mailto:advice@camstudentadvice.co.uk). The GU has a Welfare Officer who you can always [contact for support](mailto:welfare@gradunion.cam.ac.uk). The Welfare Library at the GU Lounge also has information on topics including alcohol and drugs, health problems, crime, pregnancy and much more.

The BA society has an officer dedicated to supporting and representing LGBT+ people within the college. If you identify as LGBT+ and are having any problems or if you are questioning your sexual orientation or gender identity then [get in touch with the LGBT+ Representative](mailto:ba.lgbt@trin.cam.ac.uk). Other organisations which support and organise events for LGBT+ people are the college's LGBT society, [1TQ](https://www.facebook.com/1tqcantab/), and the university wide organisation [CUSU LGBT+](http://www.lgbt.cusu.cam.ac.uk/). You can also add yourself to the Trinity BA Society LGBT+ mailing list [here](http://lists.cam.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/trin-balgbt).

There are many other organisations in Cambridge which can deal with more specialised issues. Note that some of the student-run lines run only during termtime, and some at limited times. An excellent source for more counselling and advice services is provided on the University website and may be found [here](http://www.cam.ac.uk/local/advice.html).
